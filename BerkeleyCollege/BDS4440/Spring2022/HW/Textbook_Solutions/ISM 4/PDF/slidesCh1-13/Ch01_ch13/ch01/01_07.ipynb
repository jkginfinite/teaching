    "* Some reasons why Python is popular:\n",
    "    * Open source, free and widely available with a massive open-source community\n",
    "    * Easier to learn than many other languages, enabling novices and professional developers to get up to speed quickly\n",
    "    * Easier to read than many other popular programming languages\n",
    "    * Widely used in education.\n",
    "    * Enhances developer productivity with extensive standard libraries and third-party open-source libraries\n",
    "        * Programmers can write code faster and perform complex tasks with minimal code\n",
    "    * Massive numbers of free open-source Python applications\n",
    "    * Popular in web development (e.g., Django, Flask)\n",
    "    * Supports popular procedural, functional-style and object-oriented programming\n",
    "    * Build anything from simple scripts to complex apps with massive numbers of users, such as Dropbox, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Quora\n",
    "    * Popular in artificial intelligence, which is enjoying explosive growth, in part because of its special relationship with data science\n",
    "    * Widely used in the financial community\n",
    "    * Extensive job market for Python programmers across many disciplines, especially in data-science-oriented positions, and Python jobs are among the highest paid of all programming jobs"
